Up until this point, we have taken a simplistic approach to shadows. By only considering single point light sources we can only produce naive and simplistic "hard" shadows (as illustrated in the left hand image below). If we want to implement more realistic "soft" shadows (as illustrated in the right hand image below) we are going to need a more sophisticated approach. View the animation linked to above for a deeper understanding of what we are trying to achieve.

The simplest (but by no means most efficient) way to implement soft shadows is to use multi-point light sources. View the slides and audio narration linked to above for a high-level explanation of how to implement this approach. If you decide to implement soft shadows using this technique, be prepared for a significant increase in rendering time !
