Finding the closest intersection between a ray and a set of triangles is a costly activity. This is especially true for complex models where each ray being cast must be checked against a potentially very large number of model triangles. There would be a considerable computational cost saving if we could limit the number of triangles in a model, but still render the surfaces with complex surface geometry. Take a look at the slides, narration and animation linked to above to find out how we can "fake" complex geometry (using "light & shadows"), whilst at the same time keeping the number of model triangles to a minimum.
