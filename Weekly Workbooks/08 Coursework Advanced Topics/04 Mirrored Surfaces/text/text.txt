Rather than rendering triangles as just opaque, matt surfaces, it would be nice if we could simulate more interesting and complex materials. The slides, audio narration and animation above provide details of how to render triangles as reflective surfaces. We start out by performing a standard "closest intersection" calculation. However, rather than shading the image plane pixel the colour of the intersected triangle, we "bounce" the ray off the surface - using the formula shown in the above slides. The colour of the triangle that is _subsequently_ hit is the one that is then used to shade the pixel. In this way, we can achieve the rendering of mirror-like reflective surfaces.
