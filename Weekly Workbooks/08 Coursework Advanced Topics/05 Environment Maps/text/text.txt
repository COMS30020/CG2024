The problem with rendering mirrored surfaces is that they reflect _everything_ that surrounds them ! The large number of resultant calculations can make rendering complex scenes particularly costly. We can however use flat images in the form of "Environment Maps" to capture a view of the surrounding area from the perspective of a 3D object. Due to the fact that these maps are flat images (rather than 3D models in their own right) this can make the computation of reflections much more efficient. The slides and audio narration above provide a high-level introduction of this approach to rendering.
