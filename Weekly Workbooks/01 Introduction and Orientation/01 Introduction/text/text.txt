The aim of this introductory workbook is to ease you gently into the first week of term. The main objective is to make sure you are able to build and run the code template project. This is of crucial importance because this template is the starting point for **ALL** of the work you will undertake on this unit. Getting the template project working _might_ take some time and perseverance (depending on the operating system you intend to use for this unit). It is **ESSENTIAL** that you achieve everything in this workbook during the first week of term. If you are unable to build and run applications, you will quickly find yourself falling behind on this unit.
