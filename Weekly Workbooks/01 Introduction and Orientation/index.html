<h3 id="task-1-introduction">Task 1: Introduction</h3>
<p>The aim of this introductory workbook is to ease you gently into the
first week of term. The main objective is to make sure you are able to
build and run the code template project. This is of crucial importance
because this template is the starting point for <strong>ALL</strong> of
the work you will undertake on this unit. Getting the template project
working <em>might</em> take some time and perseverance (depending on the
operating system you intend to use for this unit). It is
<strong>ESSENTIAL</strong> that you achieve everything in this workbook
during the first week of term. If you are unable to build and run
applications, you will quickly find yourself falling behind on this
unit.</p>
<h1 id="section"></h1>
<h3 id="task-2-language-and-libraries">Task 2: Language and
Libraries</h3>
<p>The implementation language for this unit will be C++. Although
everybody may have their own preferred language for writing code, C++ is
still very much a standard for low-level graphics rendering
applications. The aim of this unit is to develop a fundamental
understanding of graphics rendering and as such, we will NOT be making
use of any existing rendering frameworks (such as OpenGL or DirectX).
Instead, we will building our own rending engines ! That said, the
practical exercises will make use of the following two external
libraries: -
<a href="https://github.com/g-truc/glm" target="_blank">GLM</a> for
general purpose mathematical operations (mostly for manipulating vectors
and matrices) -
<a href="https://www.libsdl.org" target="_blank">SDL2</a> for drawing to
the screen (mostly setting the colour of individual pixels !)</p>
<p>Remember: The aim of this unit is to learn to build things from the
ground-up, so don’t use anything other than SDL2 and GLM when
implementing the practical exercises (and in the coursework itself).</p>
<p>In order to make things a little tidier, we have provided a “wrapper”
object that encapsulates the SDL2 library which we have called
<code>DrawingWindow</code>. This wrapper initialises SDL, opens up a
window for drawing to the screen and provides various methods for
drawing and interacting with the user. The <code>DrawingWindow</code>
object has the following methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>DrawingWindow</code> constructor for the drawing window class
that takes 3 parameters:
<ul>
<li>Horizontal resolution for the window (integer width)</li>
<li>Vertical resolution for the window (integer height)</li>
<li>Whether or not to scale the window into full-screen mode
(boolean)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code>setPixelColour</code> sets an individual pixel (indicated by
[x,y] coordinates) to a specified ARGB colour</li>
<li><code>getPixelColour</code> returns the colour of the pixel
indicated by [x,y] coordinates</li>
<li><code>renderFrame</code> draws all pixels to the screen (until you
call this, all pixel changes are just in a memory buffer)</li>
<li><code>savePPM</code> saves the currently rendered content of the
window to a .ppm image file</li>
<li><code>saveBMP</code> saves the currently rendered content of the
window to a .bmp image file</li>
<li><code>clearPixels</code> clears all pixel colours (from the whole
window)</li>
<li><code>pollForInputEvents</code> checks to see if there are any
events waiting to be processed (returns true if there are !)</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of how to call the methods of the <code>DrawingWindow</code>
class are included in the
<a href="extras/RedNoise/src/RedNoise.cpp" target="_blank">template
project</a>.</p>
<h1 id="section-1"></h1>
<h3 id="task-3-using-your-own-computer-native-os">Task 3: Using Your Own
Computer (Native OS)</h3>
<p>We have tried to use a programming language and set of libraries that
are agnostic to the underlying architecture and operating system. As a
result, it should be <em>fairly</em> straight-forward to get things
running on most machines. Note however that we will test and mark the
coursework assignment on the lab machines, so you should avoid using any
platform-specific features that aren’t available on the lab
machines.</p>
<p>The template project we have provided assumes that you have the
<code>clang</code> complier installed (which many of you may already
have !). If you do not currently have <code>clang</code>, you can either
install it now or alternatively (if you have a different compiler
already installed) update the <code>COMPILER</code> variable in the
project Makefile to reflect the compiler that you do have installed (so
that it uses <code>g++</code> or <code>cl</code> for example).</p>
<p>You can use an IDE for development if you wish (CLion, Visual Studio,
Eclipse, XCode etc). We have provided a CMake file inside the project
root folder to help you configure and build your project. CLion works
well as an IDE and is able to open the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file
as a project. If you prefer to use VSCode instead then you will need to
install some extensions - see
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/cmake-linux" target="_blank">this
tutorial</a> for a step-by-step guide. If you do use an IDE then please
make sure that your project can still be compiled outside of the IDE
(i.e. by providing a Makefile that works on the lab machines).</p>
<p>Installation of SDL2 can sometimes be non-trivial (due to the fact
that it must link with native graphics libraries). For this reason, the
recommended way to install it is using a package manager (e.g. apt, rpm,
yum, brew, ports, pacman etc). The name of the required SDL2 package
will vary depending on your platform. Here are some likely candidates
for a range of different package managers:</p>
<pre><code>apt install libsdl2-dev
rpm -i SDL2-devel
yum install SDL2-devel
brew install sdl2
port install libsdl2
pacman -S sdl2</code></pre>
<p>If you can’t get your package manager to install SDL2 (or if you
don’t have a package manager at all !) then you will have to install it
manually. Various useful resources are available online for achieving
this, but you might like to start by taking a look at
<a href="https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/01_hello_SDL/" target="_blank">this
tutorial</a>. If you are really struggling to install SDL on your
existing operating system, then the following sections provide some
alternatives you might like to consider.</p>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
The code template (that we will introduce later in this workbook) comes
bundled with the GLM library built-in, so there is no need for you to
install this yourselves !</p>
<h1 id="section-2"></h1>
<h3 id="task-4-using-your-own-computer-resident-os">Task 4: Using Your
Own Computer (Resident OS)</h3>
<p>If you are having difficulties installing SDL2 on your existing
operating system, you might find things easier using a fresh operating
system install. We have created a
<a href="extras/Vagrantfile" target="_blank">Vagrant configuration
file</a> that can be used to bring up a virtual machine with all of the
required tools and libraries installed. See the comments at the top of
the configuration file for instructions on how to get started with
Vagrant.</p>
<p>Alternatively (if you are confident to do so) it might be worth
considering a “fresh” install of your preferred linux distribution. It
should be relatively straight-forward to install SDL2 on a clean linux
install using a decent package manager. You might even like to consider
dual booting your computer (if you are brave enough to do so !)</p>
<p>It is possible to build and compile the template project using
Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Recent versions of Windows
<em>should</em> be able to run graphical linux applications seamlessly
(i.e. without having to install and configure XWindows/X11). Note that
if you have an older version of Windows 10, you might need to do a
software update in order to allow graphical applications to work
out-of-the-box.</p>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
If using a virtual machine, you should avoid using display scaling
(i.e. use VirtualBox in 100% “Unscaled Output” mode) otherwise you may
experience a reduction in window manager performance.</p>
<h1 id="section-3"></h1>
<h3 id="task-5-using-the-lab-machines">Task 5: Using the Lab
Machines</h3>
<p>As an alternative to getting SDL2 installed on your own computer, you
might choose to compile and run your code on the lab machines in MVB
(which have all of the required software installed). The lab machines
can either be used physically (whilst you are actually in the lab) or
remotely (via remote desktop services). In order to gain remote access
you will need to use the <em>X2Go</em> client. Full instructions for
installing and running the <em>X2Go</em> client can be found in
<a href="https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/itservices/SitePages/fits-engineering-linux-x2go.aspx" target="_blank">this
how-to guide</a>. It is worth noting however that the quality of your
experience using this approach will vary depending on the quality of
your internet connection.</p>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
For help resolving problems with remote access to the lab machines,
check out the
<a href="https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/itservices/SitePages/contacts.aspx" target="_blank">IT
services help page</a> in particular the rapid response teaching support
helpline !</p>
<p>If you get a warning that <code>GLX is not supported</code> when
remote logging in to the lab machines using X2Go then you will need to
disable hardware acceleration in the template project. Open the
<code>libs/sdw/DrawingWindow.cpp</code> file and change the value of the
<code>flags</code> variable from <code>SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL</code> so that
it now reads <code>SDL_WINDOW_FOREIGN</code>. This will disable hardware
acceleration and <em>should</em> solve the problem - it may run more
slowly, but at least it will run !</p>
<h1 id="section-4"></h1>
<h3 id="task-6-the-template-project">Task 6: The Template Project</h3>
<p>In order to help get you started, we have provided a template project
called <a href="extras/RedNoise" target="_blank">RedNoise</a>. This
project provides the structure that you will need for the weekly
workbooks, as well as illustrating the use of the
<code>DrawingWindow</code> methods.</p>
<p>In order to help you compile, link and run the
<a href="extras/RedNoise" target="_blank">RedNoise</a> project, a
Makefile has been provided for you inside the project root folder. This
makefile contains multiple rules to build code for different
purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>debug</code> a development build rule that will compile and
link your project for use with a debugger (gdb)</li>
<li><code>diagnostic</code> a development build rule that includes extra
memory checking and diagnosis flags.<br />
Note: this rule requires
<a href="https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html" target="_blank">Address
Sanitizer</a> to be installed (comes built-in with some C++
compilers)</li>
<li><code>speedy</code> a rule that builds an optimised “high
performance” executable (making interaction testing quicker)</li>
<li><code>production</code> a build rule to make an executable without
debug hooks (for release or distribution)</li>
</ul>
<p>Just typing <code>make</code> on its own will build the project using
the <em>debug</em> rule and run the resultant executable.</p>
<p>When you have successfully built and run the <code>RedNoise</code>
project you should see a window that looks like the below animation.
Remember that the cleanest way to quit an SDL application is by pressing
the <code>ESC</code> key ! If you have a window that you can’t close
(which does happen from time to time), you may need to kill off the
process manually using Task Manager, Activity Monitor or the
kill/killall command (depending on your platform).</p>
<p><img src="06%20The%20Template%20Project/images/RedNoise.gif" /></p>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
On some platforms you may need to #include <code>&lt;cstring&gt;</code>
in the <code>DrawingWindow</code> class (if the compiler complains that
it can’t find <code>memset</code>).</p>
<p>On some platforms you might also need to alter the #include statement
in the <code>DrawingWindow.h</code> file from <code>"SDL.h"</code> to
<code>"SDL2/SDL.h"</code> to allow the compiler to find the SDL
library.</p>
<h1 id="section-5"></h1>
<h3 id="task-7-understanding-the-template">Task 7: Understanding the
Template</h3>
<p>It is useful to spend a little time getting to know the structure of
the <a href="extras/RedNoise/src/RedNoise.cpp" target="_blank">main
class</a> in the template project. We are going to be using it a lot
over the next few weeks, so it is going to be important. The main
function in the template contains a “forever” loop which:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Polls the event queue for incoming mouse and keyboard events</li>
<li>Draws the scene to the screen memory buffer</li>
<li>Renders the memory buffer onto the SDL window</li>
</ol>
<p>Drawing the scene onto the screen buffer basically involves looping
through a pixel at a time, deciding what colour it should be, packing
that colour into an integer and setting the relevant pixel to that
colour. The <code>RedNoise</code> example just creates a random pattern
of red pixels of varying brightness. This may seem a bit pointless, but
it does allow us to make sure that the code in actually running. In
later weeks we are going to do more sophisticated (and more useful)
things with the pixels !</p>
<p>You will note from the <code>handleEvent</code> method that it is
possible to respond to both mouse and keyboard events. In the
<code>RedNoise</code> example, key presses simply print out messages to
the terminal (by directing strings to the <code>cout</code> object). In
later weeks we are going to use these event handlers to allow the user
to navigate around a scene and switch between different rendering modes.
For the time being however, just printing out messages is fine.</p>
<p>Clicking the mouse inside the SDL window will cause a screenshot of
the current content of the window to be saved to the filesystem. You
will notice that both PPM and BMP files are generated. The reason for
this is that some platforms and some image viewers can be fussy about
the format of image files. Pick whichever file format works best on your
platform and work with that.</p>
