If you are having difficulties installing SDL2 on your existing operating system, you might find things easier using a fresh operating system install. We have created a <a href="extras/Vagrantfile" target="_blank">Vagrant configuration file</a> that can be used to bring up a virtual machine with all of the required tools and libraries installed. See the comments at the top of the configuration file for instructions on how to get started with Vagrant.

Alternatively (if you are confident to do so) it might be worth considering a "fresh" install of your preferred linux distribution. It should be relatively straight-forward to install SDL2 on a clean linux install using a decent package manager. You might even like to consider dual booting your computer (if you are brave enough to do so !)

It is possible to build and compile the template project using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Recent versions of Windows _should_ be able to run graphical linux applications seamlessly (i.e. without having to install and configure XWindows/X11). Note that if you have an older version of Windows 10, you might need to do a software update in order to allow graphical applications to work out-of-the-box.
