As an alternative to getting SDL2 installed on your own computer, you might choose to compile and run your code on the lab machines in MVB (which have all of the required software installed). The lab machines can either be used physically (whilst you are actually in the lab) or remotely (via remote desktop services). In order to gain remote access you will need to use the _X2Go_ client. Full instructions for installing and running the _X2Go_ client can be found in <a href="https://uob.sharepoint.com/sites/itservices/SitePages/fits-engineering-linux-x2go.aspx" target="_blank">this how-to guide</a>. It is worth noting however that the quality of your experience using this approach will vary depending on the quality of your internet connection.
