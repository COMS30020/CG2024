If you get a warning that `GLX is not supported` when remote logging in to the lab machines using X2Go then you will need to disable hardware acceleration in the template project. Open the `libs/sdw/DrawingWindow.cpp` file and change the value of the `flags` variable from `SDL_WINDOW_OPENGL` so that it now reads `SDL_WINDOW_FOREIGN`. This will disable hardware acceleration and _should_ solve the problem - it may run more slowly, but at least it will run !
