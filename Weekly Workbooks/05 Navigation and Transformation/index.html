<p>Your render of the Cornell Box is probably looking quite good by now.
The problem is that in order to <em>really</em> test out your rendering
code, you need to view the model from a number of different angles. Take
a look and the slides and audio narration above relating to translation
and rotation (there looks like a lot of material, but each file is only
short !). Once you have an understanding of the principles, add some key
event handlers to your code that allow a user to interactively:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>translate</em> the camera <strong>position</strong> in 3
dimensions (up/down, left/right, forwards/backwards)</li>
<li><em>rotate</em> the camera <strong>position</strong> about the
centre of the scene (about-the-X-axis and about-the-Y-axis)</li>
</ul>
<p>Providing translations and rotations of the camera position allows
you to see how your render looks from different points of view. Note
that it is <em>essential</em> that your code only manipulates the
<strong>position of the camera</strong> (i.e. do not alter the vertices
within the model). There is no need to implement rotation about the Z
axis (“roll”) for this exercise - this would just make navigation messy
and complicated for the user.</p>
<p>Translating the position of the camera is relatively easy - it’s just
a case of adding (or subtracting) a suitable amount to the x, y, or z
coordinate of the camera position <code>vec3</code>. Rotation on the
other hand is a little more complicated - you will need to create a 3x3
rotation matrix (using the <code>mat3</code> class from GLM) to apply to
the camera position. Take a look at
<a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/GLSL_Programming/Vector_and_Matrix_Operations" target="_blank">this
documentation on matrices</a> to find out how to create and manipulate
matrices in GLM.</p>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
When instantiating a <code>mat3</code>, remember that GLM is <em>column
major</em> (i.e. the order the parameters are passed in should be first
column, then second column, then third).</p>
<p>GLM vectors and matrices both override the <code>*</code> operator,
so we can simply multiply the rotation <code>mat3</code> and the camera
position <code>vec3</code> together to get the new camera position
<code>vec3</code> !</p>
<p>Note that every time you change the position of the camera, the
appearance of the render will change. As a result, you will need to
re-render the entire scene (i.e. clear the pixels and redraw all of the
triangles). Rather than the event handler containing the re-drawing
code, standard practice is for all drawing code to appear inside the
<code>draw</code> function (the clue is in the name !). Note that there
is no need for your event handler to explicitly call this drawing
function - it is already called inside the main loop (assuming you
haven’t changed the code in the template). This may seem inefficient -
since the whole scene is frequently redrawn, irrespective of whether or
not the camera has moved. However (as we shall see later) various
different processes can cause the camera to move (in addition to just
key presses from the user) so it is useful to have the render refreshed
on a regular basis.</p>
<h1 id="section-1"></h1>
<h3 id="task-3-camera-orientation">Task 3: Camera Orientation</h3>
<p><a href='03%20Camera%20Orientation/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'>
<img src="../../resources/icons/slides.png" /> </a>
<a href='03%20Camera%20Orientation/audio/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'>
<img src="../../resources/icons/audio.png" /> </a>
<a href='03%20Camera%20Orientation/animation/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'>
<img src="../../resources/icons/animation.png" /> </a></p>
<p>When you start to move the camera around using the features added in
the previous task, you quickly get to the point where the model is no
longer visible from the camera position. What we really need is to be
able to alter the <em>orientation</em> of the camera (i.e. by panning
and tilting) so that we can keep the model in view.</p>
<p>View the slides, audio narration and animation linked to above
relating to camera orientation. Then add a new <code>mat3</code> matrix
to your code to hold the current right/up/forward orientation of the
camera. Use this orientation matrix to adjust the camera-to-vertex
direction vectors when projecting vertices onto the image plane.</p>
<p>In order to fully test out these new features, add event handlers to
your code so that the user can alter the orientation of the camera using
suitable keys on the keyboard: rotating the camera in the Y axis
(panning) and X axis (tilting). Again, rotation about the Z axis makes
navigation messy and complex for the user, so there is no need to
implement this in your code at this stage.</p>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
When altering the camera orientation, we again need to create a 3x3
rotation matrix (just as we did for manipulating the camera position).
Similarly, we can make use of the <code>*</code> operator to multiply
together the rotation matrix and the camera orientation matrix to
calculate the new camera orientation.</p>
<p>Note that the multiplication operation used to apply the camera
orientation to the camera-to-vertex vector, is NOT commutative (i.e. the
order of the operands WILL affect the outcome of the calculation). When
using the camera orientation in your code, you should therefore ensure
you use the ordering as shown in the lecture slides, namely:
<code>adjustedVector = cameraToVertex * cameraOrientation</code>.
Switching the order of these operands can result in strange and
unexpected results !</p>
<h1 id="section-2"></h1>
<h3 id="task-4-orbit">Task 4: Orbit</h3>
<p><a href='04%20Orbit/animation/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> <img
src="../../resources/icons/animation.png" /> </a></p>
<p>It is a bit of a pain to have to keep manually moving the camera
around the scene using the keyboard each time we want to get a different
perspective on a model. To ease this problem (and to make testing of
your renderer easier) we will now include some additional code that
automatically animates the position of the camera.</p>
<p>More specifically, add some code to your project that rotates
(“orbits”) the <strong>position</strong> on the camera, about the Y
axis, around the centre of the Cornell Box. See the animation linked to
above for an illustration of what you are aiming to achieve - this is a
view from above showing the orbiting of the camera around the model.
Note that there is no audio narration in this video.</p>
<p>Implementing the “orbit” feature will involve applying a very small
rotational transformation to the camera <strong>position</strong> every
time your code iterates through the main loop. As such, you
<em>could</em> put the additional “orbit” code inside the main loop.
<em>However</em> it is standard practice (and arguably tidier) to put
the orbit code inside the <code>draw</code> function (which already gets
called during each iteration of the main loop).</p>
<h1 id="section-3"></h1>
<h3 id="task-5-lookat">Task 5: LookAt</h3>
<p><a href='05%20LookAt/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'> <img
src="../../resources/icons/slides.png" /> </a>
<a href='05%20LookAt/audio/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> <img
src="../../resources/icons/audio.png" /> </a>
<a href='05%20LookAt/animation/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> <img
src="../../resources/icons/animation.png" /> </a></p>
<p>The problem with the “orbit” feature described above is that you will
soon lose sight of the model. This is because, although the camera
<em>position</em> is orbiting, the camera <em>orientation</em> remains
the same (so the camera will always be looking off in the same
direction). To solve this problem, you should implement a
<code>lookAt</code> function as described in the above slides and audio
narration. This function should take a single parameter - a point in 3D
space that the camera should “look at” (point towards).</p>
<p>You should call your new <code>lookAt</code> function each time your
“orbit” code has changed the position of the camera. By passing in the
centre of the scene as a parameter, the <code>lookAt</code> function
will ensure that the camera is <em>always</em> oriented towards the
centre of the scene (so that the Cornell Box model will always remain
visible). See the animation linked to above for a demonstration of the
effect that you should be trying to achieve from the point of view of
the camera (note: there is no audio narration for this particular
animation !)</p>
<p>Include an event handler in your code which allows the user to toggle
(switch on and off) the above animation by pressing the <code>o</code>
key. Sometimes they aren’t going to want to be constantly orbiting the
model !</p>
<h1 id="section-4"></h1>
<h3 id="task-6-texture-mapping-in-3d-optional">Task 6: Texture Mapping
in 3D (optional)</h3>
<p><a href='06%20Texture%20Mapping%20in%203D%20%28optional%29/slides/segment-1.pdf' target='_blank'>
<img src="../../resources/icons/slides.png" /> </a>
<a href='06%20Texture%20Mapping%20in%203D%20%28optional%29/audio/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'>
<img src="../../resources/icons/audio.png" /> </a></p>
<p>The aim of this optional task is to integrate the texture mapping
function that you <em>might</em> have implemented in a previous workbook
into your 3D rasteriser. If you didn’t fully implement the texture
mapping function previously, or are behind with the workbook tasks, then
you might like to skip this current task for the time being. Don’t worry
- there will be an opportunity to revisit texture mapping later in this
unit (using an approach that is considerably easier to implement than
rasterised texturing).</p>
<p>If you do decide to tackle this optional task, take a look at the
slides and audio narration above for more information on how OBJ files
handle textures. Use this knowledge to extend your file parsing
functions to read and then store the additional texture information.
Note that the <code>ModelTriangle</code> class contains an array of
<code>TexturePoints</code> to help you maintain the relationship between
triangle vertices and texture point coordinates.</p>
<p>Rather than drawing the floor of the Cornell Box model as two plain
green triangles, you should texture these triangles using our usual
<a href="models/texture.ppm" target="_blank">texture image</a>. To help
you in this task, we have provided an
<a href="models/textured-cornell-box.mtl" target="_blank">updated OBJ
materials file</a> and an
<a href="models/textured-cornell-box.obj" target="_blank">updated OBJ
geometry file</a> both of which contain additional texture information
(namely: a new textured material called “Cobbles”, texture mapping
points for some of the vertices in the model and a reference to the
texture image filename).</p>
<p>Try to get your render looking <em>similar</em> to that shown in the
diagram below. Don’t spend too long trying to get the textured floor
looking <em>exactly</em> right (because you’ll never actually manage to
do it ;o) You might have an intuition that something isn’t
<em>quite</em> right with this approach to texture mapping in 3D. Try
not to worry too much about this for the moment - we will return to the
topic of texture mapping in a later workbook (spoiler: the problem
relates to depth and perspective !)</p>
