Your next task is to implement a "Specular" lighting effect (as illustrated in the introductory animation to this workbook). The slides and audio narration in this current section provide a description of specular light and how to calculate the brightness of points on a specularly illuminated surface.

This process involves calculating the outgoing angle of reflection of an incoming beam from the light. This in itself is more complex than you might initially think. For this reason, we have included an additional slide and audio narration in order to help you calculate this particular element. View these now if you haven't done so already. As with the previous tasks, you should again make use of the GLM `dot` function, as well as the surfaces normals that you calculated previously. 

The image below provides some examples of the kinds of specular highlighting effect you might expect to see for different exponent values. You should use a relatively large exponent in the calculation of specular spread (for example 256). This will ensure that you get a tightly focused spot of light, which will be easier to see than a specular highlight with a wider spread. It can be difficult to distinguish between the various different lighting effects if the parameters used are too subtle (for example, proximity lighting can look a lot like a specular spot with a wide spread !). You might even like to switch off the other forms of lighting in your code so that you can clearly see the specular effect.
