In the real world, light bounces off objects (potentially multiple times) in order to illuminate "hard to reach" areas of a model (even areas that are in shadow). View the slides and audio narration for more insight into this notion of "Indirect Illumination". As you might imagine, calculating this kind of lighting (which would involve multiple bounces) would be computationally very expensive. It is possible however to implement a plausible approximation to such lighting with very little additional effort (both in terms of computational power and lines of code ;o)

One approach to creating such "ambient" lighting is to implement a "minimum threshold" as illustrated in the image below. Compare the shadow regions of this image with those of the previous week's workbook (which included no ambient lighting). This involves the use of an IF statement (or call to the `max` function) to ensure that the brightness of any point never falls below a certain threshold level.
