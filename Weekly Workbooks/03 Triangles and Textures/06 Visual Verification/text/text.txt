The final part of this week's workbook is to verify that your texture mapping function is working correctly. In order to test out your code, you should attempt to texture a triangle that consists of the following three vertices:

| Canvas Point |
|:------------:|
|  (160, 10)   |
|  (300, 230)  |
|  (10, 150)   |

You should fill this triangle with pixels from the example texture map, mapping canvas points to texture map points as follows:

| Canvas Point |   | Texture Point |
|:------------:|---|:-------------:|
|  (160, 10)   | → |   (195, 5)    |
|  (300, 230)  | → |   (395, 380)  |
|  (10, 150)   | → |   (65, 330)   |

If all goes to plan, you should end up with a textured triangle that looks like the one illustrated in the screenshot below. Note that along the lower edge of the triangle, 7 separate stones can be seen. If your render doesn't show all 7, then it is not correct !
