Weekly Briefing <img src="../../resources/icons/briefing.png" />

<h3 id="task-1-introduction">Task 1: Introduction</h3>
<p>As usual, make sure you have seen the weekly briefing above before
attempting to complete this week’s workbook tasks. Note that you will
will need to be
<a href="https://www.ole.bris.ac.uk/auth-saml/saml/login?apId=_183_1&amp;redirectUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ole.bris.ac.uk" target="_blank">logged
into Blackboard</a> already in order for the link to the weekly briefing
video to work (because, you know - Blackboard).</p>
<p>Although we are still working primarily in 2 dimensions, the aim of
this week’s workbook is to build up a collection of useful drawing
functions that can be used later on in the unit. Much of the later work
in future workbooks will be in 3D. However, as we shall soon see, we
will still need to do a lot of 2D drawing (strange but true). After all,
screens/displays are by their very nature two dimensional !</p>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Make sure you read the “Hints and Tips”
at the end of each section before attempting that task. This might save
you a lot of time and anguish !</p>

<a href='02%20Line%20Drawing/audio/segment-1.mp4' target='_blank'> <img
src="../../resources/icons/audio.png" /> </a></p>
<p>We start this week by writing one of the core building blocks of any
graphics framework - a function to draw straight lines. Although this
might seem simple and almost trivial, there are some technical
implementation issues that prove an interesting challenge !</p>
<p>View the slides and audio narration linked to above and then, using
the knowledge you have gained, add a function to your code to draw a
simple line in the SDL window. Your function should accept as parameters
a <code>from</code> point and a <code>to</code> point. A
<code>CanvasPoint</code> class has been provided in the
<code>libs/sdw</code> folder to help you. Add
<code>#include &lt;CanvasPoint.h&gt;</code> to the “includes” section of
your code in order to import this class. The class is used to represent
a particular point on the drawing window (what is often called the
drawing “canvas”). If you open the <code>CanvasPoint</code> class you
will see that it contains the x and y coordinates of the point, as well
as a number of other attributes. You can just ignore these additional
attributes for the time being - we will use them in subsequent
workbooks.</p>
<p>You should also allow a colour to be passed into your function so
that a line of a particular colour can be drawn. A <code>Colour</code>
class has also been provided for you in the <code>libs/sdw</code> folder
- this class contains values for red, green and blue channels as well as
an optional name for the colour (don’t worry about naming your colours
for this workbook - we will use colour names in a later exercise). Add
<code>#include &lt;Colour.h&gt;</code> to your code in order to import
this class.</p>
<p>Test your code by drawing some lines to and from some easily
verifiable positions (i.e. lines we can easily see have been drawn
correctly). For example, you might like to try the following: - A line
from the top-left corner of the window to the centre of the window - A
line from the top-right corner of the window to the centre of the window
- A vertical line all the way down the middle of the screen - A
horizontal line a third the width of the screen, centred both
horizontally and vertically</p>
<p><img src="02%20Line%20Drawing/images/lines.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
Use the knowledge of interpolation you gained from last week’s workbook
(and the functions you wrote) to help you construct your line drawing
function.</p>
<p>Note that the <code>CanvasPoint</code> and <code>Colour</code>
classes both override the <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operator, so you can
direct them straight to <code>cout</code> for debugging purposes !</p>
<h1 id="section-1"></h1>
<h3 id="task-3-stroked-triangles">Task 3: Stroked Triangles</h3>
<p>Now let’s make our drawing functions a bit more sophisticated by
drawing a more complex shape - a triangle ! Triangles are going to form
the basic building block for the rest of this unit - they are incredibly
powerful and we can achieve much using them.</p>
<p>Add a new function to your code that draws “stroked” (unfilled)
triangles. This function should draw the three outer edge lines of a
triangle that is passed in as parameters. A <code>CanvasTriangle</code>
class has been provided in the <code>libs/sdw</code> folder to help you.
This class represents a 2D triangle for drawing onto the screen/canvas.
This class contains an array of three <code>CanvasPoints</code> that are
used to store the vertices of the triangle. Add
<code>#include &lt;CanvasTriangle.h&gt;</code> to your code in order to
import this class.</p>
<p>In order to make your code more versatile, add an additional
parameter to your triangle drawing function that allows a colour to be
passed in (so that triangles of different colours can be drawn). You
should use the same <code>Colour</code> class that was introduced in the
previous task to represent the colour of the triangle.</p>
<p>In order to make your application interactive, add to the event
handling function of your main class so that when the <code>u</code> key
is pressed, your triangle drawing function is called. The parameters
passed to your function should be a <code>CanvasTriangle</code> of 3
randomly generated vertices and a randomly generated colour.</p>
<p>Test out your code by pressing the <code>u</code> key (lots of times
!!!).<br />
You should end up with a screen that looks something like the one
below.</p>
<p><img
src="03%20Stroked%20Triangles/images/stroked-triangles.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
A sensible way to approach the challenge of drawing a triangle is to
make use of your previously implemented line drawing function (to draw
the three sides of the triangle).</p>
<p>In completing this task, you might like to use the standard C
<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/rand/" target="_blank">rand</a>
function to help. This function returns a random integer between 0 and
32767 (depending on platform !). In order to bring this integer into a
desired range, we can use the modulus operator <code>%</code>. For
example <code>rand()%256</code> will give us a random number in the
range 0-255.</p>
<p>Note that the <code>CanvasTriangle</code> class overrides the
<code>&lt;&lt;</code> operator so that you can direct instances of this
class straight to <code>cout</code> for debugging purposes.</p>

<p>Drawing filled triangles is more difficult than you might think !
Take a look at the media linked to by the buttons above (you will notice
that there are a number of them - reflecting the complexity of this
task). Note that you do NOT need to implement the interactive features
demonstrated in the above animations - these are just for illustration
purposes. You should however write a new function that takes a
<code>CanvasTriangle</code> and a <code>Colour</code> as parameters and
draws a suitable <em>filled</em> triangle.</p>
<p>As well as drawing a <em>filled</em> triangle of the specified
colour, your function should also draw a <strong>white</strong>
<em>stroked</em> triangle over the top of it (this is to make sure that
your “rasterising” is correct - both filled and stroked triangles should
line up !)</p>
<p>Make your application interactive, so that pressing the
<code>f</code> key will cause a randomly coloured filled triangle to be
drawn at a random position on the screen. You should end up with a
screen that looks something like the one below.</p>
<p><img src="04%20Filled%20Triangles/images/filled-triangles.jpg" /></p>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
When testing your filled triangle drawing code, watch out for “skipped”
lines (as illustrated in the orange triangle below). These skipped lines
are due to floating point values being truncated (“chopped off”) when
they are converted into integer pixel row numbers. When converting from
floats to ints you should be sure apply a suitable rounding function.
Note that you may have to use different rounding strategies, depending
on what <em>kind</em> of integer position you are calculating (e.g. row
number, x start position, x end position etc). The best advice we can
give here is to <em>try</em> something and see if it <em>looks</em> OK
(if it doesn’t, then try an alternative !). The ethos of this unit is
very much about learning through “experimentation and exploration” !</p>
<p><img src="skipped-line.jpg" /></p>
<p>Just in case you need it: you might like to use the standard C
<a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/utility/swap/" target="_blank">std::swap</a>
function if you need to do any sorting ;o)</p>

<p>In this next exercise, rather than filling a triangle with just a
<em>single</em> colour, you will load in a “texture map” of pixels from
a file and use these to “colour” the triangle. View the slides, audio
narration and animations above to gain an understanding of how to do
this. Again, the interactive features (i.e. dragging points around the
screen) do NOT need to be implemented - these are just for demonstration
purposes in the animations. All you need to do is to write a function
that will draw a textured triangle when provided with a suitable texture
map.</p>
<p>To help you in this task, a <code>TextureMap</code> class has been
provided for you in the <code>libs/sdw</code> folder. This class has a
constructor that takes the filename of a PPM image as a parameter and
will load the pixel data in from that file for you. A sample
<a href="texture.ppm">PPM texture map</a> has been provided for you to
use in this task. We recommend that you use this texture map (rather
than any other PPM file) because you will be able to compare your
results with the screenshot of correct output shown later in this
workbook. In addition to this, there are various different variants of
the PPM file format and not all of them can be loaded successfully by
the <code>TextureMap</code> class.</p>
<p>Each <code>TextureMap</code> object has a publicly accessible
<code>pixels</code> attribute that holds all of the pixel data that has
been loaded in from the PPM file. This <code>pixels</code> attribute is
a single dimension vector of pixel-packed RGB integers. Note that there
is no representation of x or y positioning within the data. The pixel
data is just stored linearly: pixels from one row flow directly into
those from the next row (which is pretty typical for pixel data !). The
vector contains pure RGB data - there is no concept of a “newline” or
“end of row” marker. You will need to work out the positioning of pixels
yourself. There are however publicly accessible <code>width</code> and
<code>height</code> attributes of the <code>TextureMap</code> class that
you can use to find out the dimensions of the original image.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that the <code>CanvasPoint</code> class has a
<code>TexturePoint</code> variable. This has been provided to help you
maintain a link between triangle vertices and positions on a texture
map. In reality, linking <code>CanvasPoints</code> to
<code>TexturePoints</code> is a very illogical thing to do (for reasons
we will talk about later). Maintaining these links here will however
make things quick and easy for the time being (until we get around to
creating some more complex and appropriate classes).</p>
<p><strong>Hints &amp; Tips:</strong><br />
Any new canvas points you create (e.g. when splitting triangles) must
also be linked to a texture point (calculated by interpolating a
suitable position within the texture image).</p>
<p>Remember: although canvas triangles will be flat topped/bottomed,
their equivalent texture triangles will NOT be.</p>
<p>Be careful when calculating the texture map pixel index values. Some
of your calculations are likely to involve floating point values - if
you don’t convert these to integer index values in the right way there
is the danger that you will get a “skewed” texture !</p>
<h1 id="section-4"></h1>
<h3 id="task-6-visual-verification">Task 6: Visual Verification</h3>
<p>The final part of this week’s workbook is to verify that your texture
mapping function is working correctly. In order to test out your code,
you should attempt to texture a triangle that consists of the following
three vertices:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: center;">Canvas Point</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: center;">(160, 10)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: center;">(300, 230)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: center;">(10, 150)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>You should fill this triangle with pixels from the example texture
map, mapping canvas points to texture map points as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th style="text-align: center;">Canvas Point</th>
<th></th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Texture Point</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: center;">(160, 10)</td>
<td>→</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">(195, 5)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: center;">(300, 230)</td>
<td>→</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">(395, 380)</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: center;">(10, 150)</td>
<td>→</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">(65, 330)</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If all goes to plan, you should end up with a textured triangle that
looks like the one illustrated in the screenshot below. Note that along
the lower edge of the triangle, 7 separate stones can be seen. If your
render doesn’t show all 7, then it is not correct !</p>
