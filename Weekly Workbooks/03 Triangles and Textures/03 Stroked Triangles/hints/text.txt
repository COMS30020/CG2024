A sensible way to approach the challenge of drawing a triangle is to make use of your previously implemented line drawing function (to draw the three sides of the triangle).

In completing this task, you might like to use the standard C <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdlib/rand/" target="_blank">rand</a> function to help. This function returns a random integer between 0 and 32767 (depending on platform !). In order to bring this integer into a desired range, we can use the modulus operator `%`. For example `rand()%256` will give us a random number in the range 0-255.

Note that the `CanvasTriangle` class overrides the `<<` operator so that you can direct instances of this class straight to `cout` for debugging purposes.
