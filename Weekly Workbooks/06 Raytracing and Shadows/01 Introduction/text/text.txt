As we have seen previously, rasterising is a fast and efficient approach to rendering a 3 dimensional scene. However it has limitations - there are a number of phenomenon that are difficult (or even impossible) to achieve using this approach. In particular, rendering "light" and "shadow" is not well suited to rasterisation. For this reason, we now turn our attention to an alternative form of rendering: _ray tracing_. Take a look at the slides, audio narration and animation linked to above in order to gain a high-level understanding of the operation of _ray tracing_. Once you have grasped the basic principles, move on to the practical tasks in the rest of this workbook.

It is advisable to continue working with your current project and augment it with additional ray tracing functions. This will not only allow you to switch between different rendering modes (wireframe, rasterised, ray-traced) but will also permit "hybrid" rendering - where different elements of a scene are rendered using different rendering approaches.
