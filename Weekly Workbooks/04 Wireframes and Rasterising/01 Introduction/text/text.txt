This is the workbook we've all be waiting for - we finally start to work in 3 dimensions !

Our fundamental objective for this workbook (in fact the rest of the unit !) is to take a 3D model (specified as a bunch of vertex positions in 3 dimensional space) and attempt to render them as a 2 dimensional image on the screen. Although it might seem like there are a lot of complex tasks in this workbook, many of them make good use of the 2D drawing functions that you have previously written. For this reason, such tasks can be quickly achieved by just calling existing functions in your code.

Rendering a 3D model onto a 2D canvas requires us to take a particular perspective/viewpoint on that 3D model. This is only to be expected - a scene will look different depending on where you view it from. To aid in our discussion, we introduce the concept of a _camera_. Take a look at the slides and audio narration linked to above for a discussion of this concept. If you did not attend the briefing lecture session for this workbook, you should watch the video recording of this now (link at the top of this document) since it contains important background information about this week's tasks.

To help you in completing this workbook, you have been provided with a `ModelTriangle` class (found in the `libs/sdw` folder). This class represents a triangular plane in 3D space and contains attributes that hold the positions of its three vertices, as well as the colour of the triangle's surface. As usual, this class overrides the `<<` operator so that you can direct it to `cout` for debugging purposes.
