After you have successfully rendered a wireframe of the model, the next step is to fill those triangles ! This is going to be a lot easier than you might think !!! The image pane is 2D and you have already written a 2D "filled triangle" rasterising function in a previous workbook. Using the correct colours to fill the triangles, call this function in order to draw the Cornell Box model. The end product should look something like the image below (take a look at this week's briefing video for some reassurance - if your render looks _similar_, but slightly different).
