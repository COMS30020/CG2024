Although we have rendered a representation of our model onto the image plane, this render is basic (and a little hard to check for correctness). Our next step is to draw a "wireframe" render of the Cornell Box model onto the image plane - this makes it a lot easier to view the structure of the model. The basic principle is to create a 2D `CanvasTriangle` for each 3D `ModelTriangle` that was read in from the OBJ geometry file. To achieve this, you should make use of your `projectVertexOntoCanvasPoint` function in order to convert 3D model vertices into 2D canvas positions.

In order to draw the 2D canvas triangles onto the image plane, you can make use of your 2D stroked triangle drawing function (that you wrote for the previous workbook). You see - the time spent working in 2D was useful after all ! If everything works correctly, you should end up with a wireframe render that looks something like the image below.
