A good way to tackle this problem is to start by creating variables for the four corners of the window and initialising them with the following primary colours:

``` cpp
glm::vec3 topLeft(255, 0, 0);        // red 
glm::vec3 topRight(0, 0, 255);       // blue 
glm::vec3 bottomRight(0, 255, 0);    // green 
glm::vec3 bottomLeft(255, 255, 0);   // yellow
```

Then, using your previously written `vec3` interpolation function to help:
1. Calculate the colour of all the pixels in the first (left-most) column of the window
2. Calculate the colour of all the pixels in the last (right-most) column of the window
3. For each row, calculate the colour of each pixel in that row by interpolating between the first and last pixels
